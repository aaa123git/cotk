i think we could import the old comments via rsync, but from there we need to go via email. I think it is easier than caching the status on each bug and than import bits here and there  
 it would be very easy to keep a hash db of message-ids   sounds good  
 ok  perhaps we can ship an ad-hoc apt_prefereces  
 version?  
 thanks  
 not yet  it is covered by your insurance?  
 yes  but it's really not the right time :/  with a changing house upcoming in 3 weeks  
 you will be moving into your house soon?  posted a message recently which explains what to do if the autoconfiguration does not do what you expect  
 how urgent is #896?  
 not particularly urgent, but a policy violation  
 i agree that we should kill the -novtswitch  
 ok  
 would you consider a package split a feature?  
 context?  
 splitting xfonts* out of xfree86*. one upload for the rest of the life and that's it  
 splitting the source package you mean?  
 yes. same binary packages.  
 I would prefer to avoid it at this stage.  this is something that has gone into XSF svn, I assume?  
 basically each xfree86 upload will NOT force users to upgrade 100Mb of fonts for nothing  no something i did in my spare time. 

I'm not suggesting all - only the ones you modify.  
 ok, it sounds like you're agreeing with me, then  though rather than "the ones we modify", my idea is "the ones we need to merge"  
 oh? oops. 

afternoon all  not entirely related to warty, but if grub-install takes 5 minutes to install, is this a sign that i should just retry the install :)  
 here   
 you might want to know that thinice in warty is buggy compared to that in sid  
 and apparently GNOME is suddently almost perfect (out of the thinice problem), nobody report bugs :-P  I don't get your question, where do you want to paste ?  
 can i file the panel not linking to eds? :)  
 are you using alt ? or the windows key ?  wait for the gnome-themes, component will be added  
 i just restarted X and now nautilus won't show the desktop :(  hal isn't starting :(  
 do you think we have any interest to have hal support turned on in gnome-vfs at this point ? It increases the sources of problems for no real benefit imho ...  
 is it a known bug that g-s-t doesn't know what distribution its running on?  are there any changes to desktop-file-utils you've got hidden away?  
 somebody should really kick that guy *hard*  I've added a build-dep on libxt-dev in warty for zenity  
 arse. xt-dev? i added libx11-dev  so just libxt-dev or libxt and libx11?  for future note, the xmodmap line in that X sticky-super fixes the problem for me  
 we have planned to speak about menu organisation during the 2 weeks  I need we don't need to force it  ?  
 was away, you said ?  nope  
 the warty repository  ok, fine. Thanks  nice to get packages update every 30min instead once a day, isn't it :)  
 you'll be glad to know i've fixed my missing arrows in thinice bug  
 I've uploaded the gnome-vfs without hal support should be available rsn  
 should g2 in ubuntu do the magic dont-focus-window tricks?  join the gang, get an x-series thinkpad  sj has hung on my box, again.  what is monday mornings discussion actually about?  
 we'll have a BOF about this  so you're coming tomorrow ? 

interesting  grub-install worked with / being ext3, failed when it was xfs  i thought d-i installed the relevant kernel for your machine. i have a p4 and its installed the 386 kernel  holy crap a lot of stuff gets installed by default :)  YOU ARE INSTALLING VIM ON A BOX OF MINE  ;)  
 more like osx than debian ;)  we have a selection of python modules available for great justice (and python development)  
 2.8 is fixing them iirc  
 pong  vino will be in  enjoying ubuntu?  
 told me to come here  suggested thursday as a good day to come  
 we froze versions a while back :)  you coming today or thursday?  we're considering shifting it  yay  enjoying ubuntu?  usplash!  
 thats the one  
 so i saw your email with the mockup at the airport, but it hasn't appeared now that i've pulled my mail :|  
 i've got a better one now too, give me a minute  we've got rh9 installed on most desktops. you want me to look at up2date, right?  
 aha! no, the gui thingy  it's more wizardy  so the first page is okayish  we can do a whole load better on the second page (icons, translated descriptions)  but that's the kind of thing i was thinking about  (a single big treeview would get very scary, very quickly)  sure it's not a hurricane?  
 i think experimental is getting 2.8 too  let him work on #1217 :)  
 we call it 'universe' ;)  haha  ooh, totally  
 i want it on in sarge too but nobody else agrees  
 i fully endorse this suggestion </quimby>  how did your reinstall go? 

and because Python gives Mark a woody  
 i'm not sure if we're meant to talk about that publically yet.  
 and I thought we were a "pants off" kind of company ... :p  you need new glasses  
 mono 1.0? dude, that's going to be a barrel of laughs for totally non-release related reasons during hoary  read bryan clark's entry about NetworkManager?  
 there was an accompanying IRC conversation to that one <g>  explain ?  I guess you could ship the new png in the debian/ directory and copy them over in your rules  
 but debian/ is also part of diff.gz...  you can fix this for the common people, dude! multiple tarballs in source!  
 NOTWARTY, HTH, HAND, KTHXBYE <g>  everyone else had their macs stolen, so can't really comment  that picture of you is a classic  
 which?  the best feature of the new imac is that the old imacs are going to be cheaper!  ooh, can you add that to the wiki?  
 k.  you getting two-weeks-to-release edginess?  http://descent.netsplit.com/~scott/kids.mp3 -- but for releases  I played with an x300 about the time I bought my new laptop, it didn't feel solid at all  
 which series is yours again?  nc8000?  mmm  
 you have my sympathy  I'm trying to *find* the definition I wrote  
 it'd be on Glossary  i know i wrote one there  
 I'm trying to find the one with mdz's l33t dot madness  that would be a pretty good look for you :p  bandwidth bills?  
 i'm reverting the wifi change; i don't think the bars are the right thing, but they're better than the current one.  ooh, that'd be rad  
 not about waiting?  clearly you haven't tried to read a site that's just made slashdot?  
 (i thought someone was going to make a joke about .au bandwidth...)  especially not if you're using screen ;) 

OOo should be there and installed by default, yes  use UNKNOWN in cases where a bug component doesn't exist  uh? every British keyboard I've used is pc105  
 for me, orinoco_cs is loaded my the pcmcia layer  
 oh, you mean all of this is just plugdev? 

edd will turn up here soon too, btw  
 should we rename this chan #gnome-hackers ? :)  around ?  what's going on about desktop files ?  around ?  directly ?  
 ross is here  
 you need to go out of the sleepy mode dude  gnomedb should be 1.1.x since it's a GNOME part, right ?  
 not a high priority part, no  yeah, preferably (it's stable, 1.1 isn't)  
 I read the list, no need to send me the mails too :)  
 :P  
 have time to talk about the applets ?  should I change the default browser to firefox ? 

the X keyboard layout debconf thing should give gb as an example for england as i can never remember what the code is  
 that's going to die MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!*cough*splutter*  
 so, what is HCT?  
 the Hypothetical Changeset Tool; I'll explain it after lunch if you want  
  and this is why i turn on skip break  
 I had it on, but I was skipping breaks too much  
 you might as well set up a bot which every 5 minutes says "that is shared footprint" in all irc channels you are in 

and because Python gives Mark a woody  
 I thought it gave him a warty  
 watch out, it probably makes all your files writable or something  warty base ... has that not been set with priorities?  
 debootstrap  do you think we need ACPI fan module support in d-i?  certainly some nCipher people are a bit worried about the whole thing ...  
 yeah, we've been making far too many "feature" changes too close to the release  
 AIUI we've fixed the really broken bits
