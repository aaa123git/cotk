Any ideas on how lts will be released ?  
 already is  
 We are talking 12.04 not 10.04 

how much hdd use ubuntu default install ?  
 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements  it wont require 15gb to be honest...  
 thats why i ask how much is default install ? :) 

in my country its nearly the 27th  when will 12.10 be out?  
 planned Oct 18th according to this. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseSchedule?action=show&redirect=QReleaseSchedul  
 thanx 

it's not out  
 they probabaly are waiting for all the mirrors to sync. the release annocement will be after that.  
 waiting for many things to be setup  final warning - you don't know when it will be released, so don't suggest it will be any moment 

are the ext4 drivers stable?  
 I am not sure but the last time I checked, it wasn't  There have been numerous reports of data loss or corruption  
 you sound like it's updating to skynet. ;) 

Greetings  I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on a dualscreen set-up. I was wondering if it's possible to have the panel items (notifications, time, auth, etc.) only on one screen, rather than both  
 you're on the wrong channel for that  
 Oh, so now wanting to know my driver version is not a support discussion? :\ 

Multiply  or uee ctrl arrow left to return to the gui  
 or ctrl-arrow right (multiple times) :P  
  may depend on the timezone ;) 

or use do-release-upgrade in a terminal and see what it return  
 it will break things horribly. You can downgrade OS once the upgrade process has started  *can't downgrade  
  ikonia tnx for the warning, glad nothing irreversible happened 

anyone able to help with repairing a broken ubuntu install?  
 what is the problem?  
 uninstalled nvidia drivers, rebooted, now the system immediately enters into powersave mode for the monitor after entering a passphrase  i've tried booting into recovery mode through grub, makes no difference  
 while i will admit that nvidia drivers are not my specialty, maybe either adding a user that is in a different group or upgrading the kernel would help?
